# ðŸŒŒ 3D Solar System with Three.js

This project is a 3D interactive solar system built using Three.js, allowing users to explore the planets in a realistic virtual space. The solar system features rotating planets, orbits, and lighting effects to mimic real celestial motion. The 3D experience is enhanced using Vite for bundling and AI integration for planet descriptions.

## Features:
- Realistic 3D representation of the solar system
- Interactive camera controls to explore different angles
- Rotating planets and their orbits around the sun
- Dynamic lighting effects for a more immersive experience
- AI-powered planet information displayed upon selection

## Tech Stack:
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Vite for module bundling
- JavaScript for logic and interactivity
- AI Integration for planet descriptions

## How to Run:
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies using npm install
- Start the development server with npm run dev
- Open the app in your browser to explore the solar system!
